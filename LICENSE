License.

License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

Reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for Non-competing purposes only; and

Produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for Non-competing purposes only.

Intellectual Property.

Moral Rights.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

Patent and Trademark.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

Royalties.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

A copyright notice;

A notice that refers to this Public License;

A notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; and

A URL or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable.

Furthermore, You must indicate:

If You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

The Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URL or hyperlink to, this Public License.

Satisfaction.  You may satisfy the conditions in this section in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.  For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URL or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

Removal of Information.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by this section to the extent reasonably practicable.

Compliance.  If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter’s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

For the avoidance of doubt, Section 3(a) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for Non-competing purposes only;

If You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

You must comply with the conditions in Section 5(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Confidentiality.  You acknowledge, understand, and agree that You may gain access to Confidential Information as it relates to the Licensor or the Licensed Material.  For purposes of this section, “Confidential Information” shall include coding, databases, and other digitally stored information provided by the Licensor for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of this Public License as stated in Section 2 (Confidential Information).  You shall not:

Disclose any of such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to Your representatives, advisors, or other agents who need to know the Confidential Information to assist You, or act on Your behalf, to exercise Your rights or perform Your obligations under this Public License, who shall be required to keep the Confidential Information under similar, but in any case, no less restrictive restrictions; or

Use the Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise Your rights or perform Your obligations under this Public License.

 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Disclaimer of Warranties.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

Limitation of Liability.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.

Liquidated Damages.  Aside from any other remedies the Licensor may have at law or equity, in the event You breach the provisions of Section 3(a), you shall be liable to the Licensor for the amount You or Your agents or successors shall profit through the breach of such section, as well as any losses the Licensor may suffer as a result of such breach.  

The provisions of this section shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Enforcement.  You recognize that the Licensor would be irreparably injured by the breach of any provision of Section 3, Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, Section 7, or Section 8, and that money damages alone may not be an appropriate measure of the harm to the Licensor from such continuing breach.  Therefore, equitable relief, including specific performance of these provisions by injunction, would be an appropriate remedy for the breach of these provisions, and the Licensor may enforce the provisions of this section by either suit for damages or injunction, or both, without the need to post bond.  These enforcement rights shall be cumulative with and not successive or exclusive of any other legal remedies which may be available to the Licensor.  In the event a tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall hold that the duration and/or scope (geographic or otherwise) of any covenant contained in any of the aforementioned sections is unreasonable, then, to the extent permitted by law, said tribunal may prescribe a duration and/or scope (geographic or otherwise) that is reasonable and judicially enforceable.  You and the Licensor agree to accept such determination, subject to Your/its rights of appeal, which You and the Licensor agree shall be substituted in place of any and every offensive part of this Public License, and as so modified, the Public License shall be as fully enforceable as if set forth herein by You and the Licensor in the modified form.  The provisions of this section shall expressly survive the termination or expiration of this Public License even if You have separate claims against the Licensor.

Term and Termination.

Term. This Public License shall take effect on the date You commence exercising any Licensed Rights and extend until the earlier of:

December 31, 2022; or

The conclusion of the Incentivized Testnet, which will be announced publicly by Pylons, Inc.; or

The launch of the Pylons Mainnet, which will be announced publicly by Pylons, Inc.; or

When the Licensor terminates this Public License and Your obligations in accordance hereof. 

Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to mean the Licensor surrenders any intellectual property right in or to the Licensed Material.

Obligations Upon Termination.

If requested and applicable, You shall return any records of the Licensor to the Licensor and permanently delete all information and Adapted Material.

Legal Compliance.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

Entire Agreement.  This Public License constitutes the sole and entire agreement between You and the Licensor with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.

Assignment.  You may not assign this Public License or any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Licensor.

In such an event, the Public License shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.  If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from the Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

Waiver.  No failure by either You or the Licensor to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement, or condition of this Public License or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement, or condition.

Governing Law.  This Public License, and all matters arising out of or relating to this Public License, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, are governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (including its statutes of limitations and  choice of law statutes), without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of New York.

Arbitration.  Unless You and the Licensor agree otherwise in writing, in the event a dispute arises from, or related to, the terms or performance of this Public License, You and the Licensor shall proceed to binding arbitration before one (1) arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

Unless You and the Licensor agree otherwise in writing, the seat of arbitration shall be New York, New York.

You and the Licensor shall bear Your/its own dispute-related expenses, and attorneys’ fees may not be awarded by the arbitrator unless the arbitrator determines either party to have acted in bad faith by commencing such a dispute.

Jury Trial Waiver.  To the full extent permitted by law, You and the Licensor hereby expressly waive any and all right to a trial by jury on the issue to enforce any term or condition of this Public License.

Class Action Waiver.  Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute arising from the provisions of this Public License will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither You nor the Licensor will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which You or the Licensor acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
